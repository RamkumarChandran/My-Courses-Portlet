 * The model interface for the Host service. Represents a row in the &quot;MC_Host&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link org.gnenc.internet.mycourses.model.impl.HostImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a host model instance should use the {@link Host} interface instead.
